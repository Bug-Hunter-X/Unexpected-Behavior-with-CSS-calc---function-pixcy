The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are issues with operator precedence.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` might not behave as intended in all browsers.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, which will lead to a syntax error.
